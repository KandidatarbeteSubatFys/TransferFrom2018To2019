This directory contains scripts and programs that we used for the results in the report.
The quality of the documentation on the different programs vary, so we recommend using the tutorial.py file in the Tutorial
directory for a basic understanding of data generation and building neural networks with TensorFlow.

# Short description of the different directories:
 
ConvolutionAndMultiplicity - These are scripts used for reconstructing the multplicity of events, where convolution is used in most
                             cases

FitAndPlotDistributions - These files can be used to create function fits to the data reconstructed by the neural network and
                          by the add back routine.
