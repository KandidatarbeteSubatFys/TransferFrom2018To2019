It is advicable to read the Kandidat19_Komma_ig√•ng document that we have shared with the new
group, before starting with any tutorial. When that is done we recommend looking at the GenerelTutorial folder first, where the
comments in tutorial.py is  particulary intended to give an overview of how the neural networks in this project might be
constructed.

After the potential of the fully connected networked appear to have been reached, we then recommend checking out the tutorial on
convolution. The convolution method we used is a bit more time consuming to implement than the fully connected ones, but hopefully
the tutorial will make it a bit clearer how the method works.
