This directory contains python programs that we used building the networks whose results were used in the final report.
The quality of the documentation on the different programs vary, so we recommend using the tutorial.py file in the Tutorial
directory for a basic understanding of the structure of the programs, and then building your own programs using parts from
the scripts here.
