These are scripts used for reconstructing the multplicity of events, where convolution is used in most cases. The scripts
are not well commented and can be difficult to use as an outsider. We instead recommend looking at the convolution tutorial in the
ConvolutionTutorial folder, and then perhaps using bits of the scripts here to make your own programs.

Brief info on the scripts:

correct_order.py - used for getting matrices to use to create convolution/pooling images 

gamma_multiplicitet.py - used for reconstructing the multiplicity without convolution

gamma_mult_conv_2nn.py - using the NG-NG approach described in the report

gamma_mult_conv_nn_followed_by_big_filter.py - using the NG-NNG approach described in the report
