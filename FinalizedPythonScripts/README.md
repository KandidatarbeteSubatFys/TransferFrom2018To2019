This directory contains the finilized python scripts we used for the networks which results were used in the report. The quality of
the documentation on the different programs vary, so we recommend using the tutorial.py file in the Tutorial directory for a basic
understanding of the structure of the programs, and then using building your own programs using parts of the scripts here.
