These files lets you create txt-files using the gunedepXB/DALI-variables.
If any of the particles deposits less than 90% (this value can be changed) of its energy in the detector the event
is thrown away.
Standing in the directory of your root-file, of course with execution right for the files, do: 
./gen_data_gunedep_<NAME OF DETECTOR>.sh <NAME OF ROOT-FILE>.root
and the required txt-files should be generated.
The simulation has to be made with options: 
--det=tree-gun-edep and --tree=gunlist,<NAME OF ROOT-FILE>.root

The h102.C- and h102.h-files are deleted after process is finished.

There are scripts for both XB and DALI.
